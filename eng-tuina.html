        TuiNa (in Chinese 推拿 tūiná, from 推 tūi, “to push” and 拿 ná, “to grasp”) is the massage technique at the base of Traditional Chinese Medicine. It consists of a series of manual techniques aimed at obtaining certain results for the well-being of the person. In the language of Chinese medicine, it serves to restore the correct circulation of Qi, the vital energy that flows in the human body through the energy meridians.
        <br><br>
        In recent years, TuiNa has experienced increasing popularity due to its effectiveness and its completeness. In fact, it provides a very wide range of maneuvers to be carried out in certain points and areas of the body, with different executive variants. Fingers, hands, but also forearms and elbows are used. There are other complementary techniques for achieving the result, Cupping, Moxibustion and Gua Sha.

    <p class="paragrafo3">
        <b>Interesting fact: </b>TuiNa was recognized by the WHO in 1998 and has an immediate effect on neck pain, back pain, back pain, lumbosciatica, epicondylitis, carpal tunnel, etc., as the person undergoing the treatment will immediately feel "unblocked" in movement and pain muffled.

            <b>Cupping</b><br><br>
            It became famous thanks to Olympic champions such as Michael Phelps, it is a real fashion among VIPs as Jennifer Aniston proudly shows us.
            <br><br>
            Cupping consists of applying cups of various sizes to the area to be treated. Inside them a vacuum is created by suction with a pump or by fire, favoring the suction of the tissues. This technique stimulates blood and lymphatic circulation, which is useful for reducing muscle tension and toning the skin.

            <b>Moxibustion</b><br><br>
            Moxa, literally "the burning herb" is the secret ally of every TuiNa operator.
            The heat given off by the embers of an Artemisia cigar gives immediate relief to muscles and joints. 
            <br><br>
            The substances naturally possessed by this herb penetrate through the skin, helping in case of various problems, such as anxiety, insomnia, cold symptoms, etc.

            <b>Gua Sha</b><br><br>
            Gua Sha consists of rubbing the skin with a stone spatula to drain excess fluids and toxins. It is used for fever and cold, as it "releases" the heat and rebalances the Qi. It is also used to re-emerge the most ancient pains, deeply rooted, so that they can be permanently eliminated.
